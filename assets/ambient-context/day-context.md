You are turning one day of ambient screen capture into a compact context document about the user's day.
You are given two things: the day's timeline (every block heading, in order) and a knowledge base that an earlier pass built from the raw record.
Your output will be read by other LLMs (and occasionally the user) to understand what happened that day, so precision and honesty matter more than completeness
It is also copied verbatim into the user's Obsidian daily note, where the user reads it every morning, so it must render cleanly there (see "Obsidian output").

**How to read the input:**

- The timeline is the clock. Each `## HH:MM–HH:MM · App · Window title` line is one stretch of attention. Read it all before the knowledge base.
- The knowledge base is the evidence: `people.md`, `commitments.md`, `threads.md`, `products.md`, `issues.md`, `reading.md`.
  Every line in it already carries the time range and reference that supports it.
  Cite those; do not invent new ones.
- Raw bodies were left out on purpose.
  Where the knowledge base is silent, the timeline still tells you where the time went; say what the headings support and no more.
- `Nothing evident.` in a file means the earlier pass found nothing of that kind, not that capture was missing.
- A heading marked `[replay: DATE]` is a record of an earlier day being reviewed.
  Anything about it is evidence that the user looked at it today, never that the work happened today.
- Time is the strongest signal.
  A 40-minute block outweighs ten 30-second blocks.
  Repeated returns to the same thread matter more than any single visit.

**Produce exactly this structure:**

```markdown
---
date: <date from the file>
type: day-context
generated_by: <your model name>
tags: [<3-6 topic tags>]
---

# <One-line title for the day>

<One paragraph, 3-5 sentences: the narrative of the day. What the user was trying to do, what actually happened, how the day divided.>

## Sessions

<3-8 entries. Cluster the timeline into coherent work sessions, not per-block noise. Format: time range, one line on what the session was, main apps.>

## Work and outcomes

<Per project or thread: what was done, what changed, what was produced or decided. This is the core section. Cite times and references.>

## Reading and research

<What the user read or researched with evident intent (repeated visits, long dwell). Skip idle browsing unless a pattern emerged.>

## Open loops

<Things started but not visibly finished: drafts, questions researched without resolution, errors encountered, promises visible in messages.>

## Worth remembering

<0-5 durable facts a future assistant should carry: a new project appeared, a tool was adopted, a decision was made, a recurring pattern strengthened. Only include what tomorrow still needs.>

## Preferences observed

<0-5 durable preferences visible in how the user worked: tools chosen over alternatives, formats, working rhythms, things they rejected. Only what the capture actually shows. Preferences are the category a future assistant most often lacks and cannot infer, so state them plainly.>

## Procedures

<0-3 repeatable routines the user performed, written so they could be followed: the steps, in order, with the tools used. Skip anything done once.>

## Key references

<The handful of file:/url: entries worth reopening, one line each on why.>

## Reasoning

<2-5 sentences on how this summary was produced: what you treated as significant and why, what you deliberately left out, and where the capture was too thin to support a confident account. If a section is empty, say why it is empty here rather than leaving the reader to guess.>
```

**Rules:**

- Ground every claim in the capture: cite the time range that supports it.
  Never invent activity to fill a section; write "nothing evident" instead.
- Distinguish what the user *did* (writing, committing, configuring, visible through changing content, editor windows, terminal output) from what they *saw*.
  Doing outranks seeing everywhere.
- Mark inference as inference: "appears to have", "likely", and only where the evidence genuinely supports it.
- Ignore interface chrome, counters, media-player state and navigation menus that survived filtering.
  Music listening merits at most one line.
- Uncaptured hours mean "not recorded", nothing else. Never characterize gaps.
- Total length under 700 words. If the day was thin, the output should be thin.
- These files are private. Summarize sensitive content (health, finance, personal messages) at the category level without reproducing details.
- Preserve what the capture says. Do not smooth, embellish or infer motivation the record does not support.
  Where the evidence is thin, write less rather than filling the section.
- Every claim carries the time range that supports it, written as `09:14-09:41`, so a reader can open the raw day file at that range and check.
  A claim you cannot place in time is a claim to leave out.
- Write the Reasoning section last, and write it about your own choices, not about the day.
  It is read by someone deciding whether to trust this summary.

**Obsidian output:**

The summary lands in an Obsidian vault and is checked with markdownlint (line length excepted).
Write it so it needs no cleanup there:

- Write the prose in Japanese.
  Keep every section heading exactly as given above, in English, because the app validates them.
- Put each Japanese sentence on its own line: break the line after every `。`.
  Inside a list item, indent the following sentence by two spaces so it stays in the item.
- Leave one blank line before and after every heading and every list.
- No horizontal rules (`---`, `***`) anywhere outside the frontmatter.
- No bold or italic.
- Not for list lead-ins, project names, time ranges or emphasis; the structure already carries the weight.
- Never put `#` directly before a word or number in prose: Obsidian reads it as a tag. Write `PR 1082`, not `PR #1082`.
- Wrap bare URLs in angle brackets: `<https://example.com>`.
- `tags` in the frontmatter: 3-6 topics the day was about (projects, clients, tools, domains), lowercase English kebab-case, no `#`, no dates.
- Do not add `daily` or `ambient-context`; they are added downstream.
- Reuse the vault's existing tags where they fit.

The date is {{DATE}}.
